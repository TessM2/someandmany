Data and Code Some and Many

This repo includes code for running the models for the article "The Some and the Many"; it also includes the samples of data used to create/run the models. The full datasets, however, from which these samples are drawn, should be requested from author, due to the personal/individual nature of this social-media-based data (see article footnotes)

Finally, the repo also includes files with saved versions of the original results from running the models.
