Data and Code Some and Many

This repo includes code for training and running the models for the article "The Some and the Many"; it also includes the samples of data used to create/run the models, dataformodel1, dataformodel2, and dataformodel3. The full datasets from which these samples are drawn, however, as well as the larger sample of 50k twitter poems, should be requested from author, due to the personal/individual nature of this social-media-based data (see article footnotes).

Finally, the repo also includes files with saved versions of the original results from running the models.
