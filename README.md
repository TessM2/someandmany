Data and Code Some and Many

This repo includes code for running the models for "The Some and the Many"; it also includes the samples of data used to create/run the models. The full datasets, however, from which these samples are drawn, should be requested from author, due to the personal/individual nature of this social-media-based data. See article text footnotes.
