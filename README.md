Data and Code Some and Many

This repo includes code for training and running the models for the article "The Some and the Many"; it also includes the samples of data used to create/run the models, dataformodel1, dataformodel2, and dataformodel3. The full datasets from which these samples are drawn, however, as well as the larger samples of 50k twitter poems, should be requested from author directly, due to the personal/individual nature of this social-media-based data (see article footnotes).

Finally, the repo also includes files with saved versions of the original results from running the models, vis a vis the top feature counts for each model (as reproduced in the tables included with the article). Results of labeling the top 60 "viral" poems with the models are also included, but results of labeling larger samples of the non-viral poems are not, again, due to privacy concerns, and can be requested from the author directly (or reproduced via the code, and original datasets).
